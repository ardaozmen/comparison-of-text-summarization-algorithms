       "'Savic started all eight of his team\\'s Champions League outings in 2020-21, with the dismissal against the Blues his third in the competition. Atletico Madrid defender Stefan Savic will have to serve a four-game ban from UEFA club fixtures as punishment for his dismissal for violent conduct against Chelsea. Atleti were also ordered to pay a further €14,000 for \"improper conduct of the team\". Savic was shown a straight red card after an incident involving Chelsea\\'s Antonio Rudiger in the second leg of the Champions League last-16 tie at Stamford Bridge on March 17. Atletico lost 2-0 on English soil – Hakim Ziyech and Emerson Palmieri scoring the goals – as the LaLiga side exited the competition 3-0 on aggregate. Diego Simeone also received a warning over a late kick-off to the fixture, while the club itself received a €10,000 fine. The Montenegro international has been disciplined by UEFA for \"assaulting another player\", as well as \"directing abusive language at a match official\".'"

    "\n",
    "\"Dün gece yarısı bir sosyal medya kampanyasıyla neymiş, emperyalistlere karşı Hazine ve Maliye Bakanı'nı koruyacakmışız. Bizim görevimiz bir bakanı korumak değil, sizin ve bizim göreviniz Türk lirasını korumak.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Maalesef Türk lirası da düşmekte olduğu zirvelerden bir kademe daha aşağıya düştü. Ben Mayıs 2016'da Başbakanlığı devrettiği zaman dolar 2.85'ti. Şimdi 7.30'da tutmaya çalışıyorlar. 4 yılda Türk lirası yüzde 155 değer kaybetti. Seçilmiş son Başbakanı yerinden etmek için ayak oyunları çevirenlerin bu yüzde 155'lik değer kaybı nereden geldi diye hesap vermesi lazım.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Bize takdim ederken dediler ki 'Türk ekonomisi uçacak, etkin kararlar alacağız, Merkez Bankası kontrolümüze geçecek.' Ne oldu? 2018'ten bu yana 2 yılda Türk parası yüzde 60 değer kaybetti. Allah aşkını, Türk lirasına dünya piyasasının aksine bu değeri kaybettirenlerin Türkiye'ye yeniden itibar kazandırmaları mümkün mü? Türk lirasını bugün bu seviyeye düşürenler milli ekonomiden bahsedemezler, millete karşı bir ihanet içindedirler. Önce onlar hesap versin.\"'''"
