<h1>Abstract</h1>
<p>Text summarization is accepted as a hard task by NLP community. Availibility of data structures for text summarization is quite hard and there is a known difficulty to their production. This project’s aim is to create a general text summarization capitalizing from the knowledge of LSTM, RNN and many other libraries and methods that have text summary as one of their objective. By learning their limits and their optimum situation, a product powered by FastAPI will be developed to serve actively to people..</p>
